# E-Commerce-Order-Analysis
I have taken the "E-commerce enhanced dataset" and using Power BI i have created various charts for order analysis.

As part of my Power BI project focused on E-commerce Order Analysis, I began by sourcing a comprehensive dataset that included order-level information such as OrderID, ProductName, Sales, Profit, OrderDate, Region, and PaymentType. This dataset provided the foundation for performing detailed sales analytics. After preparing the data, I imported the CSV into Power BI Desktop and verified that all columns were properly recognized and categorized (e.g., OrderDate as Date/Time, Sales and Profit as numeric fields, etc.).

Next, I focused on building a visually informative dashboard on a single page to keep the insights centralized and user-friendly. I created key performance indicators (KPIs) using Card visuals to display important metrics including Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Orders. These values were calculated by aggregating Sales and Profit as sums, and OrderID using a distinct count.

For product-level insights, I developed a bar chart showing Sales by Product Name, where I sorted the results in descending order to highlight the top-selling products. I also implemented line charts to display the trend of sales over time by month, using OrderDate transformed into monthly buckets. This helped visualize seasonality and growth trends in sales.

Furthermore, I added a pie chart to analyze sales by Payment Type, providing a clear breakdown of how customers completed transactions (e.g., UPI, Credit Card, Cash). Additionally, I used a stacked bar chart to illustrate regional performance, showing total sales per region, which highlighted where the business is performing best geographically.

Throughout the process, I used sorting, aggregation (such as count distinct), and formatting tools in Power BI to cleanly present the data. Each visual was formatted with proper titles, labels, and a consistent color theme for professional presentation. The dashboard provides a clear, insightful overview of sales performance and customer behavior in the e-commerce space.
